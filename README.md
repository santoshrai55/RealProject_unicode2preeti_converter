# Unicode to Preeti Converter

## this is a very practical app that I have used many times in my translation projects.

I created this app few years back when some of my clients needed the translation in Nepali ttf font, called "Preeti".
I used some of the online converter tools but they didn't the convertion very much well.
So I thought myself, what if I make myself a converter.
So I made it used it as many times as I needed.

After learning the Django, I have made this app with interface.
You are free to use it yourself!
